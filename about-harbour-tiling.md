Harbour Tiling is a tiling business based in Ryde, focused on preparation-led work that lasts. I serve homes and apartments across Ryde and nearby suburbs in Sydney's north.

I started this business because I wanted to work in a way that prioritises doing things properly - with time for preparation, attention to detail, and honest communication with the people I work for.

## Why Harbour Tiling exists

I wanted to build a business where I could take the time to do things right - assess the space before quoting, explain what's involved, and focus on preparation before tiling starts.

That means checking substrates, coordinating waterproofing properly, and planning layouts before tiles go on. It's the approach I believe leads to better results.

That's what Harbour Tiling is built around.

## How I work

I work directly with homeowners, apartment owners, and sometimes builders or project managers on bathroom, kitchen, and apartment tiling projects.

My focus is on:

- **Preparation** - Checking substrates, coordinating waterproofing, planning layouts before tiles go on
- **Clarity** - Being clear about what's included, what's not, and what to expect
- **Communication** - Responding promptly, flagging issues early, and explaining what's happening at each stage
- **Finish quality** - Clean edges, aligned grout lines, consistent grouting, and a tidy site

My focus is on work that lasts - and that I'd be happy to stand behind.
