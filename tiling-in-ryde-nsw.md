Ryde isn't one type of suburb. It has post-war brick homes, 1970s renovations, federation weatherboards, and a lot of newer apartment buildings. Each of these has different conditions that affect how tiling should be approached.

That mix of old and new - often on the same street - means the assumptions that work in a newer suburb don't always apply here. What's under the floor, how the building was waterproofed, and what access looks like can vary dramatically from one job to the next.

This page explains what's different about tiling in Ryde - not to sell you anything, but to help you understand what questions to ask and what to look out for.

## Why Ryde is different

### The housing mix

Ryde's housing stock spans about 80 years:

- **Post-war brick homes (1940s–1960s)** - Often have concrete slab floors that have settled or cracked over time. Bathrooms may have been renovated once or twice already, sometimes with waterproofing that wasn't done to current standards.

- **1970s–1990s brick veneers** - Common in areas like West Ryde and parts of Eastwood. These often have timber-framed floors in wet areas, which require different preparation than concrete. Some have shower bases that were never properly waterproofed.

- **Federation and older weatherboard homes** - Found in Gladesville and parts of Putney. Timber subfloors, movement between materials, and older plumbing can complicate bathroom renovations.

- **Newer apartments (2000s–present)** - High-rise and medium-density buildings throughout Ryde, Macquarie Park, and Meadowbank. Strata rules, building access, and pre-existing waterproofing vary widely.

Each of these has different substrate conditions, different risks, and different preparation requirements.

One Ryde-specific factor: many homes here were built on reactive clay soils, which can cause slab movement over decades. Cracks in existing tiling - especially near external walls - are sometimes a sign of this, and it affects how new tiling should be prepared.

### Strata and apartment density

Ryde has a high proportion of apartments compared to many Sydney suburbs. Tiling in an apartment is different from tiling in a house:

- Building access and lift bookings
- Noise restrictions and working hours
- Strata approval for wet area work
- Pre-existing waterproofing that may or may not be documented
- Shared walls and floors that affect how sound travels

If you're planning apartment tiling in Ryde, these logistics matter as much as the tiling itself.

## Common tiling problems seen in Ryde

These are issues I've seen repeatedly in Ryde homes and apartments - not because Ryde is worse than other areas, but because of the specific mix of housing and renovation history here.

### 1. Waterproofing failures in older bathrooms

Many bathrooms renovated before 2000 were waterproofed using methods that don't meet current standards - or weren't waterproofed at all in areas like behind toilets or under vanities.

**What this looks like:**
- Tiles lifting near the shower base
- Grout that stays damp or discolours
- Musty smell that doesn't go away
- Water damage visible on the ceiling below (in two-storey homes)

**What to consider:**
If you're retiling an older bathroom, the waterproofing usually needs to be redone entirely. Tiling over a compromised membrane is a short-term fix.

### 2. Substrate movement in timber-framed bathrooms

1970s–80s homes in Ryde often have timber-framed floors in bathrooms. These flex more than concrete, which causes grout cracking and tile debonding over time - especially with large-format tiles.

**What this looks like:**
- Cracked grout lines, particularly in doorways and high-traffic areas
- Tiles that sound hollow when tapped
- Grout that keeps cracking even after regrouting

**What to consider:**
Timber substrates need specific preparation - sometimes fibre cement sheeting, sometimes decoupling membranes. The right solution depends on the floor structure and the tile format.

### 3. Poor layout and cut placement

This isn't unique to Ryde, but it's common in older renovations where time or budget pressure led to shortcuts.

**What this looks like:**
- Thin tile slivers along walls or in corners
- Grout lines that don't align between walls and floors
- Tiles that aren't centred on focal points (like shower niches or feature walls)

**What to consider:**
Layout planning (setout) should happen before any tiles are fixed. It's one of the most visible differences between careful work and rushed work.

### 4. Inappropriate tile selection

Some tiles aren't suited for wet areas, floors, or outdoor use - but get installed anyway because no one checked.

**What this looks like:**
- Tiles that become slippery when wet
- Glazed tiles cracking under foot traffic
- Outdoor tiles that flake after a few winters

**What to consider:**
Tile ratings (slip resistance, abrasion class, porosity) matter. If you're buying tiles yourself, it's worth checking with the tiler before committing.

## Apartment vs house: what's different

| Factor | House | Apartment |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Access** | Usually straightforward | Lift bookings, loading dock, strata rules |
| **Working hours** | Flexible | Often restricted (e.g., 8am–5pm weekdays only) |
| **Noise** | Neighbours may hear, but no shared walls | Sound travels through floors and walls |
| **Waterproofing** | You control it | May need strata approval; existing membrane may be undocumented |
| **Substrate** | Varies (concrete or timber) | Usually concrete, but condition varies |
| **Approvals** | Council if structural | Strata approval often required for wet areas |
| **Parking and material delivery** | Usually on-site | Street parking, lift logistics, multiple trips |
| **Long-term risk if issues occur** | Contained to your property | Water damage can affect neighbours below; may involve strata insurance |

If you're planning apartment tiling, the logistics often add time and coordination - even if the tiling scope is smaller.

## Materials and longevity

Not all tiling decisions are about looks. Some affect how long the work lasts - and in many cases, spending a bit more upfront on preparation or materials reduces the chance of problems (and costs) later.

### Grout type

- **Cement-based grout** - Standard, affordable, but porous. Needs sealing in wet areas and can stain over time.
- **Epoxy grout** - More expensive, harder to apply, but resistant to water, staining, and mould. Worth considering for showers and splashbacks.

### Tile format

- **Large-format tiles (600x600mm and above)** - Look clean, fewer grout lines, but require flatter substrates and more careful handling. Not always suitable for timber floors without extra preparation.
- **Smaller tiles and mosaics** - More forgiving on uneven surfaces, but more grout to maintain.

### Waterproofing

In NSW, wet areas must be waterproofed by a licensed waterproofer. Harbour Tiling holds a builders licence and is licensed to perform waterproofing, so we handle both waterproofing and tiling in-house, ensuring proper membrane application and curing before tiling begins.

Rushing this step is one of the most common causes of long-term failure.

## When to get advice before tiling

Not every situation is straightforward. If any of these apply, it's worth getting advice before committing to a scope or quote:

- The bathroom was last renovated more than 15–20 years ago
- There's visible damage, damp, or soft spots in the existing floor
- The building is an apartment with strata rules you haven't confirmed
- You're planning to use large-format tiles on a timber-framed floor
- The tiles you've chosen have unusual thickness, finish, or installation requirements
- You're not sure whether the existing waterproofing is intact

A short conversation can save a lot of cost and frustration later.
