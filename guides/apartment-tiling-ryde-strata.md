At Harbour Tiling we specialise in the areas of apartment tiling and unit tiling across Ryde and surrounding suburbs areas. The team have extensive experience with strata properties and understand the logistics involved with tiling in apartment buildings.

Apartment tiling requires coordination with building management for lift bookings, parking arrangements and material deliveries. The tilers at Harbour Tiling have completed tiling projects in buildings across Macquarie Park, Rhodes, Meadowbank, Ryde and other areas.

Working in apartments often involves noise restrictions and specific work hours. As such we communicate with building management to ensure compliance with building rules. We also keep work sites tidy which is important when working in shared buildings.

For bathroom tiling in apartments we can coordinate waterproofing which is completed to Australian standards. Correct waterproofing is particularly important in unit blocks where water damage can affect neighbouring properties.

Harbour Tiling are fully insured and all apartment tiling work comes with a guarantee on workmanship. We service customers throughout Ryde, West Ryde, Eastwood, North Ryde, Epping, Gladesville and surrounding suburbs areas.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing quality apartment tiling while still remaining competitive on pricing.
