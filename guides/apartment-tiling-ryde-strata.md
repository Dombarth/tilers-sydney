faq:
  - q: "Do I need strata approval for bathroom tiling in Ryde apartments?"
    a: "It depends on your scheme. Many buildings require approval (or at least notification) for wet area work. Ask your strata manager early what they need so approvals don’t delay the schedule."
  - q: "What causes the most delays on apartment tiling jobs?"
    a: "Usually logistics: lift bookings and delivery rules, parking/loading constraints, noise windows for demolition and cutting, and wet-area sequencing (including waterproofing cure time)."
  - q: "Why does apartment access affect the quote?"
    a: "Because it affects real time on the job: multiple trips for materials and waste, lift booking windows, protective coverings, and restricted work hours. Planning access upfront reduces delays."

## Quick answer (for planning)

Apartment tiling in Ryde goes smoothly when you plan four things early:

1) **Approvals** (what strata needs, if anything)
2) **Access** (lift booking, deliveries, parking, rubbish runs)
3) **Noise windows** (when demo/cutting is allowed)
4) **Wet area sequencing** (prep → licensed waterproofing → cure time → tiling)

Most apartment delays aren’t tiling problems — they’re **logistics problems**.

## Why apartment tiling is different (the practical reality)

The tiling itself may be identical to a house job, but apartments add constraints that affect time, access, and risk:

- you share common areas (lifts, corridors)
- noise travels through slabs and walls
- waterproofing issues can affect the unit below
- deliveries and rubbish disposal are controlled

A good apartment tiling job is mostly **planning and sequencing**.

## The four things that most often delay an apartment tiling job

### 1) Lift bookings and delivery rules

Many Ryde-area buildings require:

- lift booking windows
- protective coverings in lifts/corridors
- delivery coordination (time slots, loading bays)

Practical impact:

- tile deliveries may need to be scheduled precisely
- demolition waste removal can require multiple trips
- if access is missed, work may stop for a day

### 2) Parking and loading

Even small bathrooms require tools, materials, and waste runs.

If street parking is limited or loading is controlled, it’s not “minor” — it affects the day’s productivity.

### 3) Noise windows (demo and cutting)

Most strata buildings restrict noisy work.

Typical constraints:

- weekdays only
- limited Saturday windows
- no early mornings / evenings

Demolition and cutting are usually the noisiest phases. If the noise window is tight, the schedule needs to reflect that.

### 4) Wet area sequencing + cure time

A bathroom/laundry retile is governed by sequence:

- demo + prep
- licensed waterproofing
- cure time
- tiling
- grout/silicone

Cure time can’t be “negotiated” without risk.

## Approvals: what strata may ask for

I’m keeping this section practical because requirements vary by scheme.

Strata may require one or more of:

- a scope summary for wet area work
- confirmation of working hours/noise rules
- waterproofing documentation where applicable
- contractor insurance details

People-first approach: **ask your strata manager early** what they need, then plan around it.

## Bathrooms and laundries in apartments (risk is higher)

In an apartment, waterproofing failures can cause:

- damage to the lot below
- involvement of strata insurance
- more complex remediation

This doesn’t mean you should panic — it means you should plan properly and document what matters.

Key principles:

- substrate must be stable before waterproofing
- waterproofing must be done by a licensed waterproofer
- cure time must be respected
- corners/junctions are finished with silicone (movement is normal)

---

## What to do before you book work (apartment checklist)

Use this to avoid the most common avoidable delays:

1) **Confirm approvals**
   - Ask: “Do you require approval for a bathroom/laundry retile?”

2) **Confirm noise rules**
   - Ask: “What hours is demolition/cutting allowed?”

3) **Confirm lift bookings**
   - Ask: “Do trades need lift bookings and protective coverings?”

4) **Confirm waste disposal**
   - Ask: “Where can rubble be disposed of? Any rules?”

5) **Confirm waterproofing sequence**
   - Ask: “Who is the licensed waterproofer and what cure time is allowed?”

If you can answer these five, apartment tiling becomes straightforward.

## How to keep a job smooth (what works in practice)

### Document the basics

Even if the project is simple, it helps to have:

- a written scope summary
- a realistic timeline (that includes cure time)
- clarity on access (lifts, parking)

### Plan “noisy days”

Demolition and tile cutting create most complaints.

A simple approach:

- schedule demolition early in the project
- batch cutting work where possible
- keep common areas protected and clean

### Don’t compress cure time

Cure time is where people try to “save a day”. In wet areas, that day is not where you save money.
