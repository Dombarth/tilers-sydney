## Quick answer (for planning)

Outdoor patio tiling cost in Ryde depends on:

- **Area size**: Larger areas have better per-m² rates
- **Substrate condition**: Existing slab flatness, cracks, and falls
- **Drainage requirements**: Falls away from house and toward drainage
- **Movement joints**: Proper detailing for outdoor expansion
- **Tile selection**: Slip resistance, porosity, and weather suitability
- **Coverage**: Covered alfresco vs fully exposed patio

Outdoor tiling requires more planning than indoor work. The prep and detailing are what make it last.

## What drives outdoor tiling costs

### 1) Substrate condition

The existing slab or base is the biggest variable.

**Good condition (minimal prep):**
- Flat and level
- Correct drainage falls already in place
- No significant cracks
- Clean and suitable for adhesive

**Needs work (adds cost):**
- Uneven surface requiring levelling ($20-$40/m²)
- Cracks requiring treatment ($50-$150 per area)
- Poor falls requiring screed correction ($30-$60/m²)
- Old surface coating requiring removal ($15-$25/m²)

### 2) Drainage and falls

Outdoor areas must drain correctly:

- **Minimum fall**: 1:60 to 1:100 away from building
- **Direction**: Away from house, doors, and weep holes
- **Edge detail**: Clean junction with garden, lawn, or channel drain

If existing falls are wrong, correction adds significant cost.

### 3) Movement joint requirements

Outdoor surfaces expand and contract with temperature changes. Proper joints prevent cracking:

- **Perimeter joints**: Around walls, columns, steps
- **Field joints**: Every 3-4m in large areas
- **Structural joints**: At existing slab joints

Omitting movement joints is the most common cause of outdoor tiling failure.

### 4) Tile selection

Outdoor tiles must be:

- **Slip-resistant**: P rating for wet barefoot areas (P3+ recommended)
- **Low porosity**: Less than 3% water absorption for outdoor use
- **Weather-suitable**: Frost-resistant if in exposed areas

| Tile Type | Cost Range | Suitability |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Budget porcelain | $25-$50/m² | Basic outdoor use |
| Mid-range porcelain | $50-$100/m² | Good durability, more options |
| Premium/large format | $100-$200/m² | Best durability, design options |
| Natural stone | $80-$250/m² | Needs sealing, variable quality |

### 5) Coverage (covered vs exposed)

| Patio Type | Additional Considerations |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Covered alfresco | Less weather exposure, but still needs proper falls at edges |
| Partially covered | Transition zones need careful detailing |
| Fully exposed | Maximum drainage, slip resistance, and movement joint requirements |

## What makes Ryde patio tiling different

### Older homes with established landscaping

Many Ryde homes have patios built 20-40 years ago:

- Original concrete may have settled or cracked
- Falls may drain toward the house (common in older builds)
- Garden beds and established plants limit access

### Varied construction quality

Ryde's housing mix means substrate quality varies:

- **Post-war homes**: Often solid concrete, but may have settled
- **1970s-90s builds**: Variable substrate quality, some poor drainage
- **Newer builds**: Usually better substrates, but still need assessment

### Access considerations

Side access in Ryde properties varies:

- **Good access**: Easy material delivery, standard pricing
- **Limited access**: May require manual handling, adds to labour
- **No vehicle access**: Wheelbarrow runs, significant labour increase

3. **Where are movement joints planned?**
4. **What slip rating do the tiles have?**
5. **What adhesive and grout for outdoor conditions?**
6. **What happens if substrate is worse than expected?**

### Red flags

- No mention of movement joints
- No discussion of drainage/falls
- Indoor tiles specified for outdoor use
- No assessment of existing substrate
- Significantly lower price without explanation
