faq:
  - q: "How much does a kitchen splashback cost in Ryde?"
    a: "Kitchen splashback tiling in Ryde typically ranges from $800-$2,500 depending on size, tile type, layout complexity, and outlet placement. The biggest variables are tile format and how many cuts are required around power points and windows."
  - q: "Is kitchen floor tiling more expensive than splashbacks?"
    a: "Yes, kitchen floor tiling generally costs more due to larger area, substrate preparation requirements, and the need for durable grout. Floor tiling also usually happens before cabinetry, adding coordination complexity."
  - q: "What makes kitchen tiling quotes vary so much?"
    a: "The main variables are tile size and format, number of cuts required (outlets, windows, corners), substrate condition, grout type, and whether the job requires coordination with other trades like cabinet makers and benchtop installers."

## Quick answer (for planning)

Kitchen tiling cost in Ryde varies based on:

- **Job type**: Splashback, floor, or feature wall
- **Tile format**: Subway tiles vs large-format vs mosaics
- **Cut complexity**: Outlets, windows, corners, and edge finishing
- **Substrate condition**: Wall flatness and floor preparation
- **Coordination**: Timing with cabinet makers and benchtop installers

A simple splashback is one of the more straightforward tiling jobs. Floor tiling and complex layouts cost more.

## Kitchen splashback cost factors

### Size and coverage

Most splashbacks cover the area between benchtop and overhead cabinets - typically 600mm high and the full length of the kitchen run.

**Typical ranges for Ryde:**
- Small splashback (under 2m²): $800-$1,200
- Medium splashback (2-4m²): $1,200-$1,800
- Large/wrap-around splashback (4m²+): $1,800-$2,500+

These are labour + materials estimates. Tile cost is additional if you're supplying your own.

### Tile type and format

**Subway tiles (standard)**
- Labour impact: Lowest
- Easy to handle, efficient installation

**Large-format tiles**
- Labour impact: Medium
- Requires flatter walls, more careful handling

**Mosaics/small format**
- Labour impact: Higher
- More grout lines, more time per m²

**Patterned/decorative**
- Labour impact: Higher
- Layout planning critical, more waste

**Natural stone**
- Labour impact: Higher
- Sealing, careful handling, matching

### Cut complexity

Cuts around power outlets, light switches, and window reveals add time. The more outlets in the splashback area, the more cuts required.

**What increases cut complexity:**
- Multiple power points in the splashback zone
- Window reveals requiring L-cuts or returns
- Corners and end caps
- Rangehood cut-outs

A splashback with 4+ outlets takes significantly longer than one with 1-2.

### Edge finishing

How the splashback terminates affects both look and cost:

- **Exposed edges** (minimal): Cheapest, but requires straight-edged tiles
- **Metal trim profiles**: Mid-range, clean finish
- **Mitred edges**: Higher cost, seamless look
- **Silicone only**: Standard at benchtop junction

## Kitchen floor tiling cost factors

Kitchen floor tiling is more involved than splashbacks because:

1. Larger area = more materials and labour
2. Substrate preparation is more critical (flatness, stability)
3. Grout needs to handle foot traffic and cleaning
4. Often needs coordination with cabinetry timing

### Substrate preparation

Kitchen floors may require:

- Grinding high spots
- Levelling compounds for low areas
- Crack treatment if slab has movement
- Primer application

**Prep cost impact**: Can add $200-$600 to a floor job depending on condition.

### Tile selection for floors

Kitchen floors need durable, cleanable tiles:

- **Porcelain tiles**: Most common, durable, good value
- **Ceramic tiles**: Lower cost but less durable for high-traffic
- **Natural stone**: Higher cost, requires sealing
- **Large-format (600x600+)**: Cleaner look but needs flatter substrate

### Grout considerations

Kitchen floors benefit from:

- **Epoxy grout**: More expensive but stain-resistant, easier to clean
- **Sealed cement grout**: Standard option, needs periodic resealing
- **Colour choice**: Darker grouts hide staining better in kitchens

## What makes Ryde kitchen tiling different

### Older homes

Many Ryde homes have kitchens renovated in the 1990s-2000s with:

- Walls that aren't perfectly flat
- Existing tiles that need removal
- Plaster that may need repair

Older substrate = more prep time.

### Apartments

Ryde's apartment density means many kitchen jobs involve:

- Lift bookings and material staging
- Noise restrictions during cutting
- Coordination with strata if significant work

### Trade coordination

Kitchen tiling usually happens after cabinetry and benchtops. This means:

- Timing needs to align with cabinet maker
- Benchtop must be installed before splashback
- Appliances may need temporary removal

Poor coordination adds cost and delays.

## How to compare kitchen tiling quotes

### Questions to ask

1. **What substrate prep is included?** (levelling, repairs, priming)
2. **How are outlets and cuts handled?** (included or extra)
3. **What grout is included?** (cement vs epoxy)
4. **What edge finishing is included?** (trims, mitres, silicone)
5. **What's the timing requirement?** (coordination with other trades)
6. **What happens if walls aren't flat enough?**

### Red flags

- No mention of substrate condition
- Vague "prep as required" without detail
- No discussion of outlet cut-outs
- Unrealistic timeline without seeing the site
