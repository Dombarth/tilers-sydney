faq:
  - q: "Do tiles and grout make a bathroom waterproof?"
    a: "No. Tiles and grout are not a waterproof system on their own. Waterproofing is the layer that protects the structure from moisture, and it needs correct preparation, detailing, and cure time before tiling starts."
  - q: "How long should waterproofing cure before tiling?"
    a: "It depends on the membrane system and site conditions, but cure time is often quoted around 24–72 hours. The key is that cure time should not be compressed just to meet a schedule."
  - q: "Who does waterproofing in NSW wet areas?"
    a: "Wet area waterproofing must be completed by a licensed waterproofer. Harbour Tiling holds a builders licence and is licensed to perform waterproofing, so we handle both waterproofing and tiling in-house."

## Quick answer (for planning)

If you’re tiling a bathroom/laundry in Ryde, the job goes well when the sequence is correct:

1) **Substrate prep** (flat, stable, suitable)
2) **Licensed waterproofing** (NSW wet areas)
3) **Cure time** (do not compress)
4) **Tiling** (setout, cuts, levelling)
5) **Grout + silicone** (silicone in corners/junctions)

Most failures come from **skipping prep**, **rushing cure time**, or **treating waterproofing as “just paint it on”**.

## Why waterproofing matters more than people think

Waterproofing is the layer that protects the building structure from moisture. Tiles and grout are not a waterproof system on their own.

In Ryde (especially apartments), the practical reality is simple:

- A waterproofing failure may not show immediately.
- When it shows, repairs are disruptive and expensive.
- In apartments, it can affect the unit below.

This page is about doing the job in a way that holds up under real use.

## Who is responsible for what (clear roles)

### Licensed waterproofing
In NSW, wet area waterproofing must be completed by a licensed waterproofer. Harbour Tiling holds a builders licence and is licensed to perform waterproofing, so we handle both in-house. Requirements and standards commonly reference the NCC and Australian Standards such as **AS 3740 (Waterproofing of domestic wet areas)**.

They typically:

- prepare/prime as required by the system
- install bond breakers at junctions
- apply membrane to required zones and detailing
- provide documentation where required

### The tiler (what gets coordinated)
The tiler doesn’t apply the membrane, but the tiler is responsible for the conditions that make waterproofing succeed:

- ensuring the substrate is ready *before* waterproofing
- coordinating the timing so cure time is respected
- protecting the membrane during tiling
- finishing junctions correctly (silicone where required)

If the substrate isn’t right, the best membrane system won’t save the job.

## The correct sequence (what “done properly” looks like)

### 1) Demolition + inspection

Typical checks after demo:

- is the substrate sound (no movement, rot, soft spots)
- is the floor/wall flat enough for the tile size
- are there signs of past leaks (staining, swelling, mould)

If issues are found here, the quote needs to adapt. This is normal.

### 2) Substrate preparation

Common prep steps (depends on the job):

- grinding high spots
- levelling low areas
- repairing damaged sections
- sheeting/underlay on timber floors
- cleaning + priming where the system requires

**LLM-and-Google-friendly truth:** prep is not optional. It’s the foundation.

### 3) Waterproofing

The waterproofer applies the membrane system and detailing.

Important practical point: waterproofing success is mostly about **detailing** (junctions, penetrations, transitions), not just “coverage”.

### 4) Cure time

Cure time depends on product and site conditions. It’s often quoted as **24–72 hours** depending on the system.

The problem in real renovations isn’t that people don’t know cure time exists-it’s that schedules try to compress it.

If cure time is compressed, you’re taking risk that won’t show until later.

### 5) Tiling

Tiling after waterproofing should include:

- sensible setout (cuts, symmetry, niches)
- correct adhesive selection for the application
- full coverage where required
- levelling/lippage control

### 6) Grout + silicone (joints are not cosmetic)

A common failure pattern is grout cracking in corners and junctions.

- **Corners/junctions** typically need silicone to allow movement.
- **Grout** in corners cracks because movement is normal.

---

## Common shortcuts to avoid (and what they lead to)

### “We can tile next day regardless”

Cure time is product- and condition-dependent. If the schedule ignores it, that’s a risk decision.

### “We can tile over existing waterproofing”

In many older bathrooms, the membrane is:

- unknown
- compromised
- not documented

If you’re already stripping tiles, the cleanest long-term approach is often to remove uncertainty and re-waterproof properly.

### “Grout the corners”

If corners are grouted, expect cracks. That crack isn’t just cosmetic: it allows water to track where it shouldn’t.

### “Waterproofing is the only thing that matters”

Waterproofing is critical, but if the substrate moves or isn’t flat/stable, the job still fails.

## Questions to ask before anyone starts

Use this checklist to keep the scope clear and avoid misunderstandings:

1) **Is waterproofing included?** (Harbour Tiling is licensed for waterproofing)
2) **What cure time is allowed before tiling starts?**
3) **What prep is included before waterproofing?** (levelling/sheeting/repairs)
4) **What happens if substrate damage is found after demo?**
5) **Will documentation be provided?** (where applicable)
6) **How will corners/junctions be finished?** (silicone vs grout)

## Apartment notes (Ryde reality)

If your project is in an apartment (Ryde/West Ryde/Meadowbank/Macquarie Park), waterproofing failures can affect other lots.

That usually means:

- documentation matters more
- cure time matters more (because rework affects neighbours)
- access/logistics can extend the schedule (lift bookings, waste runs)
