At Harbour Tiling we coordinate waterproofing for bathroom tiling and wet area projects across Ryde and surrounding suburbs areas. The team understand the importance of correct waterproofing before tiling commences and can handle this as part of the overall project.

Waterproofing is required for all wet areas in NSW including bathrooms, laundries and shower areas. The waterproofing membrane must be applied and allowed to cure before any tiling can commence. As such it is important to allow adequate time in the project schedule.

The tilers at Harbour Tiling pride themselves on correct sequencing when it comes to waterproofing and tiling. We allow appropriate cure times for waterproofing membranes before tiling starts which is important for the longevity of the work.

For bathroom renovations we can coordinate waterproofing which is completed to Australian standards. This includes preparation of the substrate, application of the membrane and allowing adequate cure time.

Harbour Tiling are fully insured and all work comes with a guarantee on workmanship. We service customers throughout Ryde, West Ryde, Eastwood, North Ryde, Epping, Gladesville and surrounding suburbs areas.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in doing the job properly rather than cutting corners.
