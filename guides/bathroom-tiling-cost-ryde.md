At Harbour Tiling we provide bathroom tiling services across Ryde and surrounding suburbs areas. The team have experience with all types of bathroom tiling projects from small ensuites through to large main bathrooms and can provide quotes based on the scope of work required.

Bathroom tiling costs in Ryde vary depending on several factors including the size of the bathroom, tile type selected, substrate condition and whether waterproofing is required. As such it is difficult to provide exact pricing without assessing the job first.

The tilers at Harbour Tiling pride themselves on providing upfront and honest pricing with no hidden costs. We include all labour and materials in our quotes unless otherwise specified. For bathroom tiling we can also coordinate waterproofing which is completed to Australian standards.

Factors that affect bathroom tiling cost include tile size and type, complexity of the layout, substrate preparation required and access to the property. Large format tiles often require flatter substrates which can add to preparation costs.

Harbour Tiling are fully insured and all bathroom tiling work comes with a guarantee on workmanship. We service customers throughout Ryde, West Ryde, Eastwood, North Ryde, Epping, Gladesville and surrounding suburbs areas.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing quality bathroom tiling while still remaining competitive on pricing.
