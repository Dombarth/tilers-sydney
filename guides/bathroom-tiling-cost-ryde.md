## How to Compare Quotes

### Quote Comparison Checklist

Ask each tiler:

1. **What preparation is included?** (grinding, levelling, sheeting)
2. **Who is the licensed waterproofer?** What's the sequence?
3. **How much cure time is allowed?** (min 24-48 hours)
4. **What grout type?** (cement vs epoxy)
5. **Are niches/features priced separately?**
6. **What happens if substrate is worse than expected?**

### Red Flags

- No mention of waterproofing coordination
- "Prep as required" without detail
- Cure time compressed to start tiling immediately
- Significantly lower price without explanation
- Grout used in corners (should be silicone)
