faq:
  - q: "Why do bathroom tiling quotes in Ryde vary so much?"
    a: "Because the scope varies. The biggest differences are usually substrate condition and preparation, waterproofing coordination and cure time, tile format/detailing, and (for apartments) access logistics like lifts, parking and waste runs."
  - q: "Is waterproofing included in a tiling quote?"
    a: "Not always. In NSW, wet areas are waterproofed by a licensed waterproofer. A tiler typically coordinates sequencing, but you should confirm who the waterproofer is, what is included, and how long cure time is allowed before tiling starts."
  - q: "Should I choose a cheaper quote if everything ‘looks the same’?"
    a: "Only if the scope is genuinely the same. Compare what preparation is included, how waterproofing is handled (and cure time allowed), what grout/silicone detailing is included, and what happens if issues are found after demolition."

## Quick answer (for planning)

Bathroom tiling cost in Ryde varies because **scope varies**. The biggest differences usually come from:

- **Substrate condition and preparation** (what’s under the tiles, how flat/stable it is)
- **Waterproofing scope and curing time** (wet area compliance + correct sequencing)
- **Tile format and detailing** (large format, niches, mitres, floor-to-ceiling)
- **Apartment logistics** (lift bookings, parking, noise windows, waste runs)

A quote that’s cheaper because it skips prep, compresses waterproofing cure time, or avoids documentation often becomes expensive later.

If you want a realistic assessment, call <a href="tel:{{ site.data.site.contact.phone_tel }}">{{ site.data.site.contact.phone_display }}</a> and tell me whether it’s a **house/apartment**, the **age of the bathroom**, and your **tile size**.

## What you’re really paying for

Bathroom tiling isn’t only “lay tiles and grout”. You’re paying for a chain of steps that must be done in order.

In Ryde, many bathrooms have been renovated once or twice already. That renovation history is often what changes the scope.

### Step-by-step (the typical sequence)

1. **Demolition and inspection** (what’s under the tiles)
2. **Substrate preparation** (flattening, sheeting, repairs)
3. **Waterproofing** (licensed waterproofer in NSW wet areas)
4. **Cure time** (do not compress)
5. **Tiling** (setout, cuts, levelling)
6. **Grout and silicone** (correct junction detailing)
7. **Handover** (care, documentation if applicable)

The quote changes when any of these steps becomes more involved.

## The biggest cost drivers in Ryde bathrooms

### 1) Demolition + what’s underneath

A quote changes quickly if:

- existing tiles are hard to remove
- the substrate is damaged or not flat
- the bathroom has old adhesive beds that require grinding
- there is water damage or movement (especially timber floors)

**Why it matters:** tiles fail because the substrate fails.

**People-first check:** ask *what the tiler plans to do if the substrate is not suitable after demo*. A good process plans for that scenario.

### 2) Substrate preparation (flatness + stability)

Large-format tiles and clean minimal finishes demand flatness. Prep can include:

- grinding high spots
- levelling compounds
- crack isolation (where appropriate)
- fibre cement sheeting on timber floors
- decoupling membranes (where appropriate)

If prep is not included (or is vague), you’re not comparing quotes fairly.

### 3) Waterproofing scope + sequencing

In NSW, wet areas are waterproofed by a licensed waterproofer.

What changes cost:

- whether waterproofing is required (most bathroom re-tiles: yes)
- whether the existing membrane is unknown/compromised
- whether the bathroom is being partially or fully stripped
- cure time (often 24–72 hours depending on product and conditions)

**Shortcut risk:** “we can tile the next day regardless” is one of the biggest red flags.

### 4) Tile format and complexity

Tile choice changes labour and prep, even if tile price stays the same.

**Large-format tiles (e.g., 600x600 and up)** can require:

- flatter walls/floors
- more careful handling
- tighter setout planning
- more time cutting and aligning

Complexity also increases with:

- niches
- floor-to-ceiling walls
- feature walls and patterns
- mitred edges (vs trims)
- drains/falls that require precise setout

### 5) Apartment logistics (Ryde reality)

A big share of Ryde work is apartments (Ryde/West Ryde/Meadowbank/Macquarie Park).

Costs can change due to:

- lift bookings
- parking/loading restrictions
- noise windows (demo/cutting)
- multiple waste runs

This isn’t “extra for no reason” — it’s the real time it takes to do the job without causing building issues.

## Should you publish price ranges?

I’m intentionally not publishing $/m² figures here because:

- bathrooms vary too much by prep and waterproofing scope
- it invites apples-to-oranges comparisons
- it encourages quote shopping on the wrong variables

Instead, use this guide to compare scope.

If you want a *ballpark*, I can talk you through it on the phone once you describe the substrate and scope.

## How to compare quotes in a way that protects you

### A quote comparison checklist

Ask each tiler:

1. **What prep is included?** (grinding/levelling/sheeting)
2. **Who is the licensed waterproofer and what’s the sequence?**
3. **How much cure time is allowed before tiling?**
4. **What grout is included?** (cement vs epoxy)
5. **What silicone/junction detailing is included?**
6. **Is setout/layout planning included?** (cuts, symmetry, focal points)
7. **What happens if issues are found after demolition?**

If a quote can’t answer these clearly, the price alone doesn’t mean much.

### What to avoid (common causes of rework)

- vague prep (“prep as required” with no detail)
- compressed timelines that ignore cure time
- no clarity on waterproofing responsibility
- grout used in corners instead of silicone

## Want a realistic assessment?

If you tell me:

- house or apartment
- age of bathroom / last renovation
- tile size you’re considering

…I can usually explain what will drive scope (and cost) before you commit.
