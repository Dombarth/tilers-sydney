| Waste disposal | $150-$350 | Depends on bathroom size and access |
| Apartment waste runs | Add $100-$250 | Multiple trips to bins, lift logistics |

### Substrate Preparation

| Work Item | Typical Cost | Notes |

## Waterproofing Costs

In NSW, wet areas must be waterproofed by a licensed waterproofer. Harbour Tiling holds a builders licence and is licensed to perform waterproofing, so we include this in our quotes:

| Area | Typical Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Shower floor and walls (to 1800mm) | $800-$1,500 | Standard requirement |
| Full bathroom floor and wet walls | $1,200-$2,200 | Full bathroom waterproofing |
| Balcony/outdoor (if applicable) | $60-$100/m² | Trafficable membrane |

**Important:** Waterproofing must cure before tiling (24-72 hours depending on product). Quotes that compress this timeline risk failures.

## What Drives Price Up

### 1. Substrate Condition

## How to Compare Quotes

### Quote Comparison Checklist

Ask each tiler:

1. **What preparation is included?** (grinding, levelling, sheeting)
2. **Is waterproofing included?** (Harbour Tiling is licensed for waterproofing)
3. **How much cure time is allowed?** (min 24-48 hours)
4. **What grout type?** (cement vs epoxy)
5. **Are niches/features priced separately?**
6. **What happens if substrate is worse than expected?**

### Red Flags

- No mention of waterproofing coordination
- "Prep as required" without detail
- Cure time compressed to start tiling immediately
- Significantly lower price without explanation
- Grout used in corners (should be silicone)
