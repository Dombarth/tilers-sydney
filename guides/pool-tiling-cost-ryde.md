faq:
  - q: "How much does waterline pool tiling cost in Ryde?"
    a: "Waterline pool tiling in Ryde typically ranges from $1,500-$4,000 depending on pool perimeter, tile type, and existing condition. Larger pools and specialty tiles increase costs, as does the need for coping repairs."
  - q: "Is pool surround tiling more expensive than waterline?"
    a: "Generally yes, because pool surrounds cover a larger area and require more preparation including drainage falls, movement joints, and slip-resistant tile selection. Surround tiling often runs $3,000-$12,000+ depending on area size."
  - q: "What makes pool tiling quotes vary significantly?"
    a: "The biggest variables are area size, tile selection (especially slip resistance ratings), substrate condition, whether the pool shell needs repair, movement joint planning, and drainage requirements for surrounds."

## Quick answer (for planning)

Pool tiling cost in Ryde depends on:

- **Job type**: Waterline tiles, surrounds, or full renovation
- **Pool size**: Perimeter length for waterline, m² for surrounds
- **Tile selection**: Standard ceramic vs glass mosaic vs porcelain
- **Substrate condition**: Existing shell/slab repairs needed
- **Movement joints**: Proper detailing for outdoor expansion
- **Drainage**: Falls and water management for surrounds

Pool tiling is more demanding than indoor work due to chemical exposure, weather, and movement requirements.

## Waterline tiling cost factors

### Pool perimeter and tile height

Waterline tiles typically run one or two courses high around the pool perimeter.

**Typical ranges for Ryde:**
- Small pool (under 30 linear metres): $1,500-$2,500
- Medium pool (30-45 linear metres): $2,500-$3,500
- Large pool (45+ linear metres): $3,500-$4,500+

These are labour + standard tile estimates. Premium tiles (glass mosaic, designer patterns) add significantly.

### Tile selection for waterline

**Standard ceramic**
- Cost impact: Lowest
- Durability: Good
- Most common, proven durability

**Porcelain**
- Cost impact: Medium
- Durability: Excellent
- Lower porosity, better for salt pools

**Glass mosaic**
- Cost impact: Highest
- Durability: Excellent
- Premium look, requires skilled installation

**Natural stone**
- Cost impact: High
- Durability: Variable
- Needs sealing, careful chemical exposure

### Pool shell condition

Before waterline tiling, the shell condition matters:

- **Good condition**: Minor prep, standard install
- **Minor damage**: Patching and repair adds $300-$800
- **Significant damage**: May need render repair, adds $1,000+

Old waterline tiles may have damaged the shell edge over time.

### Coping integration

Waterline tiles meet the pool coping. If coping needs repair or replacement, this adds cost:

- **Coping in good condition**: Standard install
- **Minor coping repairs**: $200-$500
- **Coping replacement**: $1,500-$4,000+ depending on material

## Pool surround tiling cost factors

Pool surrounds are outdoor tiling with additional requirements: slip resistance, drainage, and movement management.

### Area size

**Typical ranges for Ryde:**
- Small surround (under 15m²): $3,000-$5,000
- Medium surround (15-30m²): $5,000-$8,000
- Large surround (30-50m²): $8,000-$12,000+
- Full pool renovation: $12,000-$25,000+

### Slip resistance requirements

Pool surrounds must be slip-resistant when wet. Tiles are rated P1-P5 for wet barefoot areas:

- **P3 minimum** recommended for pool surrounds
- **P4-P5** for steps, ramps, and high-risk areas

Higher slip ratings often mean textured surfaces = more grout to clean, but safer.

### Substrate preparation

Outdoor substrates need:

- **Existing surface removal**: $15-$25/m² for old tiles
- **Levelling for drainage falls**: $20-$40/m²
- **Crack repair**: $50-$200 per area
- **Waterproofing** (if over living space): $50-$100/m²

### Movement joints

Outdoor surfaces expand and contract. Proper movement joints are critical:

- **Perimeter joints**: Around pool edge, walls, columns
- **Field joints**: Every 3-4m in large areas
- **Control joints**: At slab joints and stress points

Missing movement joints = cracking within 1-3 years.

### Drainage and falls

Pool surrounds must drain away from the pool and away from the house:

- **Standard falls**: 1:60 to 1:100 gradient
- **Complex drainage**: May need additional channels
- **Junction detailing**: Clean meeting with pool coping

## What makes Ryde pool tiling different

### Established backyards

Many Ryde homes have pools installed 20-40 years ago:

- Existing surrounds may have settled or cracked
- Original drainage may be inadequate
- Access through established gardens adds logistics

### Mixed construction types

Ryde pools range from:

- **Concrete shells**: Most common, good for tiling
- **Fibreglass**: Limited tiling options (usually waterline only)
- **Pebblecrete/render**: May need assessment before tiling over

### Weather exposure

Sydney's climate means pool tiles face:

- UV exposure (affects some adhesives and grouts)
- Temperature swings (movement stress)
- Heavy rain (drainage critical)
- Salt air in some areas (material selection)

## How to compare pool tiling quotes

### Questions to ask

1. **What substrate prep is included?** (shell repair, levelling, old tile removal)
2. **What tiles are specified?** (slip rating, porosity, warranty)
3. **Where are movement joints planned?**
4. **How is drainage being handled?** (falls, direction, edge detail)
5. **What adhesive and grout for pool conditions?**
6. **What happens if shell damage is found?**

### Red flags

- No mention of movement joints
- No discussion of drainage falls
- Tiles not rated for outdoor/pool use
- Unrealistic timeline without assessing substrate
- No plan for chemical exposure (grout type)
