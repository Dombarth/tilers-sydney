The tilers at Harbour Tiling pride themselves on attention to detail when it comes to bathroom tiling. This includes proper substrate preparation, correct waterproofing sequencing and allowing adequate cure times before tiling commences.

Our bathroom tiling services include floor tiling, wall tiling, shower tiling, bath surrounds, feature walls and niche installations. We work with ceramic tiles, porcelain tiles, natural stone, mosaics and large format tiles depending on what is required for the job.

For bathroom tiling in apartments we have experience with strata logistics including lift bookings, parking coordination and working within building noise restrictions. The team have completed bathroom tiling projects across Ryde, West Ryde, Eastwood, North Ryde, Epping, Gladesville and surrounding suburbs areas.

Substrate preparation is an important part of bathroom tiling that many other tilers may overlook. We check what is underneath existing surfaces including concrete slabs, timber floors or old tiles and prepare accordingly.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing quality bathroom tiling while still remaining competitive on pricing.
