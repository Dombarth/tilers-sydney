Bathroom tiling is one of the most common tiling jobs. It's not inherently complicated - but problems do occur when shortcuts are taken during preparation or waterproofing. Water, humidity, and daily use put steady stress on tiles, grout, and the membrane underneath, so the work needs to be done properly from the start.

This page explains what's involved in bathroom tiling, what affects quality and longevity, and how to think about the decisions you'll need to make.

## Two kinds of bathroom tiling

Not all bathroom tiling projects are the same. The approach, materials, and level of detail differ depending on what you're trying to achieve.

### Standard bathroom tiling

This covers most bathroom renovations: a functional, well-finished result using common tile formats and materials.

**Typical scope:**
- Floor tiles (usually 300x300mm to 600x600mm)
- Wall tiles in wet areas (shower, behind vanity, around bath)
- Standard ceramic or porcelain tiles
- Cement-based grout with sealer
- Coordination with waterproofer for membrane application

**What matters most:**
- Waterproofing done correctly and allowed to cure
- Substrate flat and stable before tiling
- Layout planned so cuts fall in sensible places
- Grout lines consistent and sealed
- Silicone applied cleanly at junctions

For most bathrooms, this approach delivers a result that looks good and lasts - without overcomplicating the job. The key is that even a straightforward bathroom still needs proper waterproofing, substrate prep, and layout planning. "Standard" doesn't mean cutting corners.

### Higher-end bathroom tiling

Some bathrooms call for more attention to detail: feature walls, large-format tiles, complex layouts, or premium materials.

**Typical scope:**
- Large-format tiles (600x1200mm or bigger)
- Feature walls with pattern or accent tiles
- Floor-to-ceiling tiling
- Niche recesses and shelving
- Epoxy grout in wet areas
- Mitred edges instead of trim profiles
- Underfloor heating integration

**What matters most:**
- Substrate preparation becomes more critical (large tiles show imperfections)
- Layout planning takes longer (symmetry, focal points, transitions)
- Grout colour and joint width affect the final look significantly
- Edge finishing requires more precision
- Sequencing with other trades (plumber, electrician, waterproofer) needs closer coordination

Higher-end work isn't about using expensive tiles - it's about the level of planning and execution behind them.

## What affects how long bathroom tiling lasts

### Waterproofing

In NSW, wet areas must be waterproofed by a licensed waterproofer before tiling. Harbour Tiling holds a builders licence and is licensed to perform waterproofing, so we handle both waterproofing and tiling in-house:

- The substrate must be ready before waterproofing
- The membrane must cure fully before tiling (usually 24–72 hours depending on product and conditions)
- Any damage to the membrane during tiling must be repaired

Waterproofing failures are one of the more common causes of bathroom problems - and they're usually not visible until damage appears.

**Trade-off to consider:** Allowing proper curing time adds a day or two to the schedule, but it's time well spent.

### Substrate condition

Tiles are only as stable as what's underneath them. Before tiling, the substrate needs to be:

- Flat (within tolerance for the tile size)
- Stable (no movement or flex)
- Clean (no dust, paint, or contaminants)
- Primed if required

On timber floors, this often means installing fibre cement sheeting or a decoupling membrane. On concrete, it may mean grinding or levelling.

**Trade-off to consider:** Proper substrate prep takes time, but it's what prevents grout cracking and tile problems down the track.

### Tile format and layout

Larger tiles look cleaner (fewer grout lines), but they're less forgiving:

- They require flatter substrates
- They're harder to handle and cut
- Layout mistakes are more visible
- They're not always suitable for small or irregular spaces

Layout planning (setout) determines where cuts fall, how tiles align across walls and floors, and whether the result looks considered or rushed.

**Trade-off to consider:** Larger tiles may cost more in preparation and labour, even if the tiles themselves are affordable.

### Grout type

- **Cement-based grout** is standard, affordable, and works well in most situations - but it's porous and needs sealing in wet areas.
- **Epoxy grout** is more expensive and harder to apply, but it's waterproof, stain-resistant, and doesn't need sealing. It's worth considering for showers and floors.

**Trade-off to consider:** Epoxy grout adds cost, but reduces maintenance and mould risk over time.

## Common issues in bathroom tiling

These are problems I see regularly - not because tilers don't care, but because time or budget pressure leads to shortcuts.

### Grout cracking in corners and junctions

Grout shouldn't be used in corners or where tiles meet other surfaces (like walls meeting floors). These areas need silicone, which can flex with movement. Grout cracks.

### Hollow tiles or uneven surfaces

If a tile sounds hollow when tapped, the adhesive didn't make full contact - often because it was spread too thin or dried before the tile was set. Lippage (one tile sitting higher than its neighbour) usually means the substrate wasn't flat enough or levelling clips weren't used.

### Water pooling on the floor

Bathroom floors should fall toward the drain. If water pools in corners or against walls, the fall wasn't set correctly - and over time, this can contribute to moisture issues.

### Grout discolouration in showers

If grout turns dark or patchy in wet areas, it's usually a sealing or ventilation issue. Unsealed cement grout absorbs water and supports mould growth.

## What to expect during a bathroom tiling job

1. **Demolition and prep** - Existing tiles removed, substrate inspected, repairs and levelling completed
2. **Waterproofing** - Applied by a licensed waterproofer, then cured (allow 1–3 days)
3. **Layout planning** - Tile setout marked, cuts and focal points decided
4. **Tiling** - Floor first (usually), then walls; tiles set and levelled
5. **Grouting and silicone** - Grout applied after adhesive cures, silicone at junctions
6. **Sealing and handover** - Grout sealed if needed, final clean, care guidance provided

A standard bathroom typically takes 3–5 days, depending on prep requirements and drying times. More complex jobs take longer.

## Questions worth asking before you commit

- Has the waterproofer been booked, and is there time for proper curing?
- What's under the existing tiles - concrete or timber? Is it stable?
- Are the tiles you've chosen suitable for wet areas and floors?
- Where will cuts fall - and have you seen a layout plan?
- What grout type is being used, and will it be sealed?
- What's included in the quote, and what's not?
- Is durability more important than finishing quickly or keeping costs as low as possible?

That last question matters. If the priority is getting it done fast or cheap, the preparation and coordination that makes tiling last often gets compressed. It's worth being honest about what you're optimising for.
