## What usually changes scope in Silverwater

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Silverwater)

- Traffic and access constraints can affect delivery and waste runs; plan logistics so the tiling days are productive.
- If the job is a wet area, waterproofing sequencing and cure time is the non-negotiable part of the schedule.
- For floors, tile selection (slip rating/finish) should match how the space is actually used.
