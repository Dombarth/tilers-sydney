## What usually changes scope in Concord

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Concord)

- A lot of work is house renovations and re-tiles: expect variation in older waterproofing history.
- Timber floors and movement are common drivers of extra prep in older bathrooms.
- Setout planning (where cuts land) is often the main quality differentiator on feature walls and bathrooms.
