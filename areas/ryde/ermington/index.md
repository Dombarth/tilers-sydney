## What tends to change from job to job in Ermington

Even within the same suburb, tiling scope varies depending on what's underneath the existing surface and how the building was constructed.

Typical variables to check:

- **Substrate type** (concrete slab, timber floor, existing tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (older waterproofing, previous leaks, mould)
- **Tile format** (large format needs flatter substrates; mosaics have more grout)
- **Cut placement / setout** (where grout lines and cuts land changes the feel of the room)

## Apartments in Ermington: access + strata logistics

If your job is in an apartment block, planning often includes:

- Lift bookings / loading rules
- Noise windows and work hours
- Parking and material delivery
- Waterproofing sequencing + curing time

## What to avoid (common causes of rework)

These are some of the issues that create expensive rework later:

- Tiling over a substrate that isn't flat/solid
- Rushing waterproofing cure times
- Poor setout leading to thin slivers in visible areas
- Selecting tiles not suited to wet areas or floors
