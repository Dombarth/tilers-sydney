## What usually changes scope in Homebush

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Homebush)

- Higher density means access and noise rules can dominate the plan (lift bookings, protection, working hours).
- If you are comparing quotes, check what preparation is actually included - that is where pricing diverges.
- For bathrooms, confirm the waterproofing provider and cure time before locking a start date.
