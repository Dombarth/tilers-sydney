## What usually changes scope in Rhodes

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Rhodes)

- High apartment density: access planning (lifts, loading, protection) often matters more than the tiling itself.
- Expect stricter noise windows for demolition and cutting in many buildings.
- If it is a bathroom/laundry retile, sequence and cure time are the difference between a smooth job and rework.
