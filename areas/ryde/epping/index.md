## What usually changes scope in Epping

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Epping)

- Mixed stock (older houses + newer apartments): the biggest variable is what is under the existing surface (timber vs concrete).
- Large-format tiles demand flatter substrates; prep scope is often what changes the quote.
- If you are in an apartment, confirm lift/parking rules early so the schedule is realistic.
