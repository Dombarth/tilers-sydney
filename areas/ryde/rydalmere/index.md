## What usually changes scope in Rydalmere

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Rydalmere)

- You can see both older housing and newer medium-density: substrate type (timber vs concrete) is a common variable.
- For renovation re-tiles, unknown waterproofing history is a frequent scope driver.
- If you are changing layouts (moving fixtures), confirm sequencing with the plumber and waterproofer early.
