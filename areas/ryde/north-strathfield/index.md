## What usually changes scope in North Strathfield

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in North Strathfield)

- A mix of apartments and houses: access logistics and substrate type both matter.
- Where parking is tight, deliveries and waste runs can extend the schedule (it is not just labour time).
- For wet areas, plan waterproofing coordination and cure time into your timeline upfront.
