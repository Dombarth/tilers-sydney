## What usually changes scope in Lidcombe

- **What's under the existing surface** (concrete, timber, old tiles)
- **Wet-area history** (previous leaks, unknown waterproofing)
- **Tile size and finish** (large format needs flatter substrates)
- **Access constraints** (parking, deliveries, strata rules)


## Local notes (what usually matters in Lidcombe)

- Mixed building types: treat every quote as a scope document (prep + waterproofing + setout), not just a price.
- If the floor is timber-framed, movement control and sheeting/underlay decisions often drive longevity.
- If the job is in a unit block, access planning reduces delays (parking, delivery windows, waste disposal).
