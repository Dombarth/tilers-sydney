This page explains how I approach tiling projects - the standards I work to, how I communicate, and what you can expect at each stage. It's here so you know what to expect before we start working together.

---

## In brief

1. I look at the space before quoting
2. I explain what's included and what's not
3. Preparation happens before tiling
4. I keep the site clean and communicate if anything changes
5. At the end, I walk you through the finished work

Most of what makes tiling last happens before the first tile goes on. That's where I focus.

## Preparation comes first

Good tiling starts with preparation - not with tiles.

Before any tiling begins, I check:

- **Substrate condition** - Is the surface flat, stable, and ready? Does it need levelling, sheeting, or priming?
- **Waterproofing status** - For wet areas, is the membrane in place and cured? If not, who's coordinating that?
- **Tile suitability** - Are the tiles rated for the intended use? Are there any handling or installation requirements?
- **Layout and setout** - Where will cuts fall? Are tiles centred on focal points? Do grout lines align where they should?

These decisions affect how the job is quoted, scheduled, and executed. I'd rather identify issues upfront than discover them mid-job.

## Clear scope and quoting

I aim to be clear about what's included in a quote - and what's not.

A typical quote covers:

- Tiling labour and adhesive/grout materials
- Layout planning and setout
- Cutting and edge finishing
- Grouting and silicone
- Basic site cleanup

What's usually *not* included:

- Waterproofing (we hold a builders licence and are licensed waterproofers, so this is included in wet area quotes)
- Demolition of existing tiles (sometimes included, sometimes quoted separately)
- Substrate repairs beyond minor prep
- Tiles and consumables you're supplying
- Rubbish removal if large volumes

If something's unclear, I'll explain it. If the scope changes during the job, I'll flag it before proceeding.

The goal is no surprises - for either of us.

## Sequencing and coordination

Tiling is often one step in a larger project - especially for bathroom or kitchen renovations. The timing matters.

For wet areas, the typical sequence is:

1. Demolition and substrate prep
2. Waterproofing (we are licensed waterproofers)
3. Waterproofing curing (1–3 days)
4. Tiling
5. Grouting and finishing

For kitchens:

1. Cabinetry installed
2. Benchtops installed
3. Splashback tiled
4. Final plumbing and electrical

If you're managing the project yourself, I'll let you know where tiling fits in the sequence. If there's a builder or project manager involved, I'll coordinate with them.

---

## Communication

I aim to be responsive and straightforward.

- I'll confirm timing before starting
- If something unexpected comes up (damaged substrate, waterproofing issues, tile problems), I'll let you know before proceeding
- I'll explain what's happening at each stage if you want to know
- If I'm running behind schedule, I'll tell you as soon as I know

I don't disappear mid-job or leave things unexplained.

---

## On-site standards

These are the standards I hold myself to during a job:

- **Clean as I go** - Dust and debris are managed throughout, not just at the end
- **Protect adjacent areas** - Drop sheets, edge protection, and care around finished surfaces
- **Respectful behaviour** - Quiet when needed, mindful of neighbours, no loud music or unnecessary disruption
- **Tools and materials organised** - Work area stays orderly, not chaotic
- **Site left tidy** - At the end of each day and at the end of the job

---

## What I check before finishing

Before a job is handed over, I check:

- **Flatness and level** - Especially on floors and large-format tiles
- **Grout consistency** - Even depth, clean lines, no voids
- **Silicone junctions** - Clean lines at corners and transitions
- **Lippage** - Tile-to-tile alignment within acceptable tolerances
- **Cleanup** - Grout haze removed, surfaces wiped down

If something's not right, I'd rather fix it before you notice than after.

---

## After the job

Once the tiling is complete:

- I'll walk you through the finished work
- I'll explain any care or maintenance (sealing, cleaning, drying times)
- If you have questions later, I'm happy to answer them

I don't disappear once the job is done. If something comes up, let me know.

---

## What I don't do

To be clear about boundaries:

- We hold a builders licence and are licensed waterproofers for wet area work
- I don't do structural work or major carpentry
- I don't project-manage full renovations
- I don't rush jobs to meet unrealistic deadlines

If a job needs more time or preparation than expected, I'll explain why. I'd rather do it properly than quickly.

## Questions?

If you want to know more about how I work, or you're thinking through a project and want to understand how tiling fits in, I'm happy to talk it through.
