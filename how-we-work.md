At Harbour Tiling we have a straightforward process for all tiling projects from initial enquiry through to completion. The team pride themselves on clear communication and keeping customers informed throughout the job.

The first step is to get in touch either by phone or through our contact form. We can discuss the scope of work and arrange a time to view the job if required. For straightforward jobs we may be able to provide a quote based on photos and measurements.

Once we have viewed the job we provide a written quote that outlines the scope of work and pricing. Harbour Tiling are upfront about costs and the quote includes all labour and materials unless otherwise specified. As such customers know what to expect before any work commences.

For bathroom tiling and wet area work we coordinate waterproofing which is completed to Australian standards. The team allow adequate cure times before tiling commences which is important for the longevity of the work.

During the tiling process we keep the work site tidy and communicate with customers about progress. If any issues arise or additional work is required we discuss this before proceeding.

On completion we do a walkthrough with the customer and provide any care instructions for the new tiles. All work comes with a guarantee on workmanship.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing a straightforward and professional service.
