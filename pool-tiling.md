faq:
  - q: "What’s the difference between waterline tiling and pool surround tiling?"
    a: "Waterline tiles are the tiles at the water level inside the pool. Pool surrounds are the external paved/ tiled areas around the pool. They have different requirements for slip resistance, drainage, and movement joints."
  - q: "Do pool tiles need special grout or adhesive?"
    a: "Pool environments involve constant moisture and chemical exposure. The correct adhesive and grout depend on the pool system and tile type; selection should account for chlorine or salt exposure and outdoor temperature movement."
  - q: "What causes pool tiles to crack or lift?"
    a: "Common causes include movement not being detailed correctly (missing joints), poor substrate preparation, incorrect materials for the environment, and water ingress behind tiles."

## Quick answer (for planning)

Pool tiling that lasts is mostly about **materials + preparation + movement**.

In Ryde-area projects, the main things to get right are:

- **Tile suitability** for outdoor use and chemical exposure (chlorine or salt)
- **Substrate condition** (flatness, stability, and repairs before tiling)
- **Movement joints** and edge detailing (so expansion/contraction doesn’t crack tiles)
- **Drainage and falls** around the pool (so water doesn’t sit and undermine the install)

## Pool tiling in Ryde: what’s different locally

Ryde and nearby suburbs have a mix of older homes and newer builds. The pool itself might be concrete, fibreglass, or rendered/masonry - and each behaves differently.

The two Ryde-specific realities that often affect pool tiling work:

1) **Renovation history is mixed.** Many pools have had partial repairs or older tile systems, which changes prep scope.
2) **Outdoor access and drainage vary by block.** Tight side access or sloped sites can change logistics and drainage planning.

## Types of pool tiling work

### Waterline tiles

Waterline tiles sit where the pool water meets the wall. They need to handle:

- constant wet/dry cycling
- cleaning and chemical exposure
- movement at the coping edge

A good waterline job is clean, level, and detailed so water doesn’t migrate behind the tile.

### Pool surrounds (outdoor tiling around the pool)

Surrounds are about safe, durable outdoor use:

- **slip resistance** (especially when wet)
- **drainage** (falls away from the pool and away from the house)
- **movement joints** (to stop cracking)
- **clean junctions** to coping, fences, and thresholds

### Repairs vs full re-tile

A repair may be appropriate when the underlying system is sound.

A full re-tile is usually the better option when:

- tiles are lifting in multiple areas
- there are signs of water getting behind the system
- the substrate is compromised
- previous work has inconsistent falls or no joints

---

## What usually changes the scope (and the price)

### 1) Substrate condition and preparation

Pool tiling is unforgiving. If the substrate isn’t stable and suitable, tiles fail.

Prep can include:

- removal of existing tiles and adhesive
- repairs to cracked/damaged areas
- flattening/levelling where required

### 2) Tile selection (especially for surrounds)

For pool surrounds, you want tiles that are:

- rated for outdoor conditions
- appropriately slip-resistant when wet
- suitable for thermal movement

If you’re choosing tiles, confirm suitability before buying.

### 3) Movement joints and detailing

Movement is normal outdoors. The job is to manage it.

Missing or incorrect joints are one of the most common reasons surrounds crack and tiles lift.

### 4) Drainage and falls

Standing water around the pool is a long-term problem.

A proper plan considers:

- where water should run
- where it should not run (toward the house)
- how junctions and edges are finished

## What to ask before you book pool tiling

Use this checklist to avoid scope surprises:

1) **What tile type is being used and is it suitable for outdoor/pool conditions?**
2) **What preparation is included?** (removal, repairs, flattening)
3) **Where are movement joints going and how will they be finished?**
4) **How will drainage and falls be handled?**
5) **Is this a repair or a full re-tile and why?**
