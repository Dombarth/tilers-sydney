At Harbour Tiling we specialise in the aspects of pool tiling and spa tiling for residential customers across Sydney and the Ryde region. The team have experience with all types of pool tiling including waterline tiles, full pool retiling and pool surround areas.

Pool tiling requires specific expertise due to the wet environment and exposure to pool chemicals. We use adhesives and grouts that are rated for pool applications to ensure longevity. Harbour Tiling are fully insured and all pool tiling work comes with a guarantee on workmanship.

The tilers at Harbour Tiling pride themselves on attention to detail when it comes to pool tiling. This includes proper surface preparation, correct tile selection and ensuring all work is completed to a high standard.

Our pool tiling services include waterline tile replacement, full pool retiling, spa tiling, pool coping and pool surround tiling. We work with ceramic pool tiles, glass mosaics and porcelain tiles depending on what is required for the job.

Pool surround tiling requires consideration of slip resistance and durability for outdoor areas. The team have experience with selecting appropriate tiles that meet Australian standards for wet areas.

We service customers throughout Sydney including Ryde, West Ryde, North Ryde, Eastwood, Epping and surrounding suburbs areas. For pool tiling projects we can provide a quote based on the scope of work required.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing quality pool tiling services.
