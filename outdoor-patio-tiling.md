At Harbour Tiling we specialise in the areas of outdoor tiling including patios, balconies, alfresco areas and entertaining spaces for customers across Sydney and the Ryde region. The team have experience with all aspects of outdoor tiling and understand the requirements for external applications.

Outdoor tiling requires specific consideration for drainage, slip resistance and durability. We use tiles that are rated for external use and adhesives that can handle weather conditions. Harbour Tiling are fully insured and all outdoor tiling work comes with a guarantee on workmanship.

The tilers at Harbour Tiling pride themselves on attention to detail when it comes to outdoor tiling. This includes ensuring correct falls for drainage, selecting appropriate tiles and proper substrate preparation.

Our outdoor tiling services include patio tiling, balcony tiling, alfresco area tiling, pool surrounds and external entertaining areas. We work with porcelain tiles, natural stone and other materials suited to outdoor applications depending on what is required.

For balcony tiling in apartments we have experience with strata logistics and waterproofing coordination. The team have completed outdoor tiling projects across Ryde, West Ryde, North Ryde, Eastwood, Epping and surrounding suburbs areas.

Substrate preparation is particularly important for outdoor areas to ensure tiles remain adhered and do not lift over time due to moisture or temperature changes.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing quality outdoor tiling while still remaining competitive on pricing.
