faq:
  - q: "What tiles are best for outdoor patios in Ryde?"
    a: "Outdoor patios need tiles rated for outdoor use with appropriate slip resistance when wet. The right choice depends on exposure, drainage, and whether the area is covered or open to rain."
  - q: "Why do outdoor tiles crack or lift?"
    a: "Common causes include poor falls and drainage, missing movement joints, unsuitable adhesives for outdoor conditions, and inadequate substrate preparation."
  - q: "Do outdoor patios need waterproofing before tiling?"
    a: "Sometimes. If the patio is over living space, a balcony/terrace system may be required. On ground slabs, correct falls, drainage, and movement joints are still critical."

## Quick answer (for planning)

<p class="cost-guide-link" style="background: #f8f8f8; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #2a9d8f; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

Outdoor patio tiling lasts when three things are handled correctly:

1) **Tile selection** (outdoor-rated + slip resistance)
2) **Falls and drainage** (water must have somewhere to go)
3) **Movement joints and detailing** (outdoors expands/contracts)

In Ryde and nearby suburbs, most failures come from **water sitting where it shouldn’t** or **movement not being detailed**.

## Outdoor tiling in Ryde: local realities

Ryde-area homes vary from older blocks with established landscaping to newer builds and medium-density housing.

Two factors that often change outdoor tiling scope locally:

- **Drainage and levels**: older patios can have inconsistent falls, garden edges, or thresholds that need planning.
- **Access**: side access and material delivery can affect staging and waste runs.

## What outdoor patio tiling usually includes

### Patios and courtyards

Typical scope:

- preparation of the base (concrete or screed)
- tile installation with outdoor-suitable materials
- grout and flexible joints
- clean junctions to walls, doors, and garden edges

### Alfresco areas

Covered alfresco spaces still get wet at the edges. The job needs:

- slip resistance that matches real use
- correct falls so water doesn’t pool
- detailing at thresholds and drainage points

---

## The main technical drivers (what changes the job)

### 1) Falls and drainage

Outdoors, water is the main enemy.

A good plan answers:

- where does water run when it rains?
- where does it drain?
- does it run toward the house, doors, or weep holes?

If water pools, grout breaks down and tiles can fail.

### 2) Movement joints

Outdoor surfaces expand and contract with temperature.

If movement joints are missing or poorly placed, cracking and lifting becomes likely.

### 3) Substrate preparation

Outdoor tiles require a stable, suitable base.

Prep can include:

- removing old finishes
- repairing cracks/spalled concrete
- levelling to achieve falls

### 4) Tile selection and slip resistance

Outdoor tiles should be:

- rated for outdoor use
- appropriately slip resistant when wet
- suitable for cleaning and exposure

If you’re choosing tiles, confirm suitability before buying.

## What to ask before you book patio tiling

1) **How will falls and drainage be handled?**
2) **Where are movement joints going?**
3) **What preparation is included?** (repairs, levelling)
4) **Are thresholds and edges detailed to avoid water ingress?**
5) **Is the tile suitable for outdoor use and slip resistance?**

## Want a quick assessment?

If you tell me:

- whether it’s covered alfresco or open patio
- approximate size
- whether water currently pools

…I can usually explain what will drive scope before you commit.
