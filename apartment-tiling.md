At Harbour Tiling we specialise in the areas of apartment tiling and unit tiling for customers across Sydney and the Ryde region. The team have extensive experience with strata properties and understand the logistics involved with tiling in apartment buildings.

Apartment tiling requires coordination with building management including lift bookings, parking arrangements, material deliveries and working within noise restrictions. The tilers at Harbour Tiling have completed apartment tiling projects in buildings across Ryde, West Ryde, Macquarie Park, Rhodes, Eastwood and surrounding suburbs areas.

We are fully licensed to carry out all aspects of tiling work and can coordinate waterproofing for bathroom renovations which is completed to Australian standards. Harbour Tiling are fully insured and all work comes with a guarantee on workmanship. As such we are able to handle apartment tiling jobs that other tilers may not have the experience for.

Our apartment tiling services include bathroom tiling, kitchen tiling, laundry tiling, floor tiling and balcony tiling. We work with ceramic tiles, porcelain tiles and large format tiles depending on what is required.

For apartment bathrooms we understand the importance of correct waterproofing sequencing and allowing adequate cure times before tiling commences. This is particularly important in unit blocks where water damage can affect neighbouring properties.

The team pride themselves on keeping work sites tidy which is important when working in shared buildings with common areas and other residents.

At Harbour Tiling we take pride in providing quality apartment tiling while still remaining competitive.
