Tiling in an apartment is different from tiling in a house. The work itself is similar, but the context changes everything: access, approvals, neighbours, noise restrictions, and the consequences if something goes wrong.

That said, these aren't problems - they're just things to plan for. With the right preparation, apartment tiling goes smoothly.

This page explains what's involved in apartment tiling - the logistics, the coordination, and what to think through before starting.

## What makes apartment tiling different

### Access and logistics

Getting materials and tools into an apartment takes planning:

- **Lift bookings** - Most buildings require trades to book lifts in advance
- **Loading dock and parking** - Vehicle access may be restricted; multiple trips may be needed
- **Deliveries** - Tile deliveries may need to be coordinated with building management

For larger jobs, this adds time to the schedule - not because the tiling takes longer, but because getting in and out does.

### Working hours and noise

Most strata buildings have by-laws that restrict noisy work:

- Typical hours: 8am–5pm weekdays, sometimes limited Saturday mornings
- Demolition and cutting are often the noisiest stages
- Some buildings require notice to neighbours or strata management

If the job involves significant demolition, the noise and dust need to be managed carefully - both for your neighbours and for common areas.

### Strata approvals

Many apartment renovations require strata approval before work begins, especially for:

- Wet area work (bathrooms, laundries) and waterproofing modifications
- Changes that affect common property or structural elements
- Work that may impact neighbours (noise, plumbing, drainage)

Approval requirements vary by building. It's worth checking with your strata manager early.

## Waterproofing in apartments

Waterproofing is important in any bathroom - but in an apartment, the stakes are higher. The principles are the same as in a house; what's different is that the impact of problems is broader.

### Why it matters more

If waterproofing fails in a house, the damage is contained to your property. In an apartment:

- Water can leak into the unit below
- Damage may affect common property (ceilings, corridors, structural elements)
- Repairs can involve multiple parties, strata insurance, and significant disruption
- You may be liable for damage to other units

### What's required

In NSW, wet areas must be waterproofed by a licensed waterproofer. The process is the same as in a house:

1. Substrate prepared and inspected
2. Membrane applied by licensed waterproofer
3. Membrane allowed to cure fully (1–3 days depending on product)
4. Tiling proceeds once waterproofing is confirmed

What's different in apartments is that documentation matters more. Many strata committees require waterproofing certificates before approving wet area work - and if problems occur later, having that documentation protects everyone.

### Pre-existing waterproofing

If you're retiling an existing apartment bathroom, the current waterproofing may or may not be intact. Questions worth asking:

- When was the bathroom last renovated?
- Is there documentation of the original waterproofing?
- Are there signs of past water damage (stains, odours, soft spots)?

If the membrane is compromised or undocumented, it usually makes sense to remove the existing tiles and re-waterproof properly - rather than tiling over an unknown situation.

## Managing risk in apartment tiling

Apartment tiling carries more risk than house tiling because problems affect others. A few things that help:

### Clear scope and documentation

Before work starts, it helps to have a clear understanding of:

- What's included (and what's not)
- What approvals are required
- Who's coordinating with strata
- What happens if unexpected issues are found (e.g., damaged substrate, old waterproofing)

### Trade coordination

In apartments, sequencing with other trades matters more. Plumbers, electricians, waterproofers, and tilers often need to work in a specific order - and delays in one trade can affect the others.

If you're managing the renovation yourself, this coordination falls on you. If you're working with a builder or project manager, they handle it - but it's still worth understanding the sequence.

### Insurance and liability

Most strata buildings require contractors to have public liability insurance. If you're hiring a tiler directly, it's worth confirming they have appropriate cover - especially for wet area work.

## Common apartment tiling scenarios

### Bathroom retile

The most common apartment tiling job. Usually involves:

- Removing existing tiles, adhesive, and often waterproofing
- Substrate inspection and repair
- New waterproofing (by licensed waterproofer)
- Tiling floors, walls, and any niches
- Grouting, silicone, and finishing

Timeline: 4–7 days depending on demolition, prep, and curing times.

### Laundry tiling

Laundries are also wet areas in NSW and require waterproofing. The scope is usually smaller than a bathroom, but the same principles apply - substrate, membrane, curing, then tiling.

### Balcony or terrace tiling

Some apartments have tiled balconies or terraces. These are exposed to weather and require different considerations:

- Drainage and falls
- Waterproofing under tiles (especially if there's a unit below)
- Tile suitability for outdoor use (slip resistance, frost resistance if relevant)
- Strata approval for external work

Balcony tiling can be more complex than indoor work because of weather exposure and structural considerations.

### Kitchen splashback

A simpler job - usually no waterproofing required, shorter timeline. The main considerations are:

- Access behind the stovetop and sink
- Clean junctions with benchtops and cabinetry
- Tile layout and alignment

Most apartment tiling jobs take 4–10 days depending on scope, access, and curing times. Building logistics often add 1–2 days compared to house work.

## What to expect during an apartment tiling job

1. **Access and setup** - Lift booking, floor protection in common areas if required, materials delivered
2. **Demolition** - Existing tiles removed, debris disposed of (may require multiple trips to bins)
3. **Substrate prep** - Inspection, repairs, levelling as needed
4. **Waterproofing** - Applied by licensed waterproofer, then cured (allow 1–3 days)
5. **Tiling** - Floors and walls tiled, layout planned to minimise waste and awkward cuts
6. **Grouting and finishing** - Grout applied, silicone at junctions, final clean
7. **Handover** - Walkthrough, care instructions, any required documentation provided

Total time depends on the scope, building access, and how much prep is needed. A straightforward bathroom might take 5–7 days; a larger or more complex job takes longer.

---

## Questions worth asking before you start

- What strata approvals are required, and how long do they take?
- Are there building access or noise restrictions I need to plan around?
- Is the existing waterproofing documented and intact?
- Who's coordinating with other trades (plumber, waterproofer, electrician)?
- What insurance does the tiler carry?
- What happens if unexpected issues are found during demolition?

These questions help avoid surprises once the job is underway.

## Ready to discuss your apartment project?

If you're planning tiling work in an apartment, unit, or strata building in Ryde or nearby suburbs, I'm happy to talk through what's involved - including access, approvals, and coordination.

No pressure, no obligation. I typically respond within one business day.

If your building has specific requirements or restrictions, let me know - I'll factor those into how we plan the job.

I won't start work until access, approvals, and scope are clear. That protects both of us.
