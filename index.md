# 3. WHY HARBOUR TILING (decision-making, not just outcomes)
why_section:
  heading: "How I decide what your project actually needs"
  content: |
    Before quoting, I work through a set of questions about your space:

    - **What's under the existing surface?** - Concrete, timber, old tiles, render? Each has different prep requirements. I check this first because it changes the scope.
    - **Does the waterproofing need to be redone?** - In wet areas, I coordinate with a licensed waterproofer. If the membrane is compromised, tiling over it is a waste of money.
    - **Where should cuts fall?** - I plan the layout so small slivers and awkward cuts don't end up in visible spots. This takes time upfront but changes how the room feels.
    - **Is the tile suitable for the application?** - Some tiles aren't rated for floors, showers, or outdoor use. I'll flag this before you buy.

    These decisions happen before tiling starts. They're what separates a job that lasts from one that looks good for a year.

# 5. RYDE AUTHORITY PREVIEW
ryde_preview:
  heading: "Tiling in Ryde: what's different here"
  text: "Ryde has a mix of post-war brick homes, 1970s–90s renovations, and newer apartment blocks. Each has different substrate conditions, waterproofing histories, and access constraints. Understanding those conditions changes how a tiling job should be quoted and planned."

# 6. PROCESS (plain English)

  steps:
    - title: "I look at the space"
      description: "Surfaces, access, and what needs to happen before tiling."
    - title: "We agree on scope"
      description: "What's included, what the tiles need, and how the layout will work."
    - title: "Prep and waterproofing"
      description: "Surface work first. Waterproofing if it's a wet area."

      description: "Tiles go on, then grouting and silicone."
    - title: "Handover"
      description: "Walkthrough, cleaning tips, and anything you need to know."

# 7. PROOF (without testimonials)
proof:
  heading: "What gets checked"
  content: |
    I don't rely on testimonials to show quality. Instead, I focus on what can be measured and documented:

    - **Flatness and level** - Checked with straight edges and levels before and after.
    - **Lippage** - Tile-to-tile height differences are minimised, especially on large-format tiles.
    - **Grout consistency** - Even depth, clean lines, no voids or gaps.
    - **Waterproofing documentation** - For wet areas, waterproofing certificates are provided by the licensed applicator.
    - **Junction detailing** - Corners, edges, and transitions finished cleanly with appropriate trims or mitres.

    If you'd like to see examples of recent work, I can share photos during our conversation - including preparation stages, not just finished results.
