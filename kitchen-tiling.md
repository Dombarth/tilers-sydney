Kitchen tiling is often simpler than bathroom work. Most kitchen tiling involves splashbacks, floors, or feature walls — and in many cases, no waterproofing is required. The focus is on layout, finish quality, and how the tiles meet other surfaces.

The key is planning early. Last-minute decisions about layout or timing can lead to compromises that are visible every day.

This page explains what's involved in kitchen tiling, what decisions you'll need to make, and what affects the result.

## Common kitchen tiling jobs

### Splashbacks

The most common kitchen tiling job. A splashback protects the wall behind the cooktop and sink, and often extends across the full length of the benchtop.

**What's involved:**
- Tiling the wall area between the benchtop and overhead cabinets
- Cutting around power outlets, switches, and window reveals
- Finishing edges cleanly where tiles meet cabinetry

**What matters most:**
- Layout: where cuts fall, how tiles align with features, whether the pattern is centred
- Junction quality: clean meeting points with benchtops, cabinets, and window frames
- Grout choice: colour, width, and whether to seal it

A well-planned splashback looks effortless. A rushed one has awkward cuts and misaligned grout lines that catch your eye every time you use the kitchen.

### Floor tiling

Kitchen floors see a lot of traffic, spills, and dropped items. The tiling needs to be durable, easy to clean, and laid flat.

Unlike splashbacks, floor tiling typically happens *before* cabinetry is installed — so the sequence is different. If you're planning both, it's worth confirming timing early.

**What's involved:**
- Preparing the substrate (concrete or timber-framed)
- Tiling with appropriate adhesive and grout
- Finishing at thresholds and where cabinetry will sit

**What matters most:**
- Flatness: especially important where furniture and appliances need to sit level
- Slip resistance: some tiles are more suitable for areas that get wet
- Grout durability: kitchen floors need grout that holds up to cleaning and foot traffic

### Feature walls

Some kitchens include a tiled feature wall — often behind open shelving or as a design accent. The scope is similar to a splashback, but the layout and tile choice may be more decorative.

## Layout and cut placement

How tiles are arranged affects how the finished kitchen looks. A few things worth thinking through:

### Centring and symmetry

For splashbacks, it often makes sense to centre the tile layout on the cooktop or rangehood — rather than starting from one edge. This avoids ending up with a thin sliver of tile in a prominent spot.

### Outlet and switch placement

Power outlets and light switches need to be cut around. The goal is to position cuts so they're clean and not awkwardly placed — ideally with the outlet near the centre of a tile, not at an edge or corner.

### Visual continuity and edge finishing

If the floor and splashback are both tiled, it can look better if grout lines align where they meet — though this isn't always possible with different tile sizes. Where tiles meet cabinetry or window frames, the edge needs to be finished cleanly (trim profiles, mitred edges, or silicone junctions). The right choice depends on the tile and the overall look.

## Coordination with other trades

Kitchen tiling usually happens after cabinetry and benchtops are installed. That means the tiler is working around fixed elements — and the fit needs to be precise.

### Timing

The typical sequence:
1. Cabinetry installed
2. Benchtops templated and installed
3. Splashback tiled
4. Final plumbing and electrical (tapware, outlets)

If the tiler starts before benchtops are in, they're working to measurements rather than to the actual surface — which can lead to gaps or misalignment.

### Access

Tiling behind a cooktop or sink is easier before appliances are connected. If appliances are already in place, they may need to be temporarily removed or protected.

### Communication

If you're coordinating trades yourself, it helps to confirm timing with the tiler, cabinet maker, and benchtop installer. A short conversation upfront avoids scheduling clashes later.

This coordination is usually simple when discussed early — most issues come from last-minute changes, not complexity.

## Tile and grout choices

### Tile type

Common choices for kitchen splashbacks include:
- **Subway tiles** — classic, affordable, easy to work with
- **Large-format tiles** — cleaner look, fewer grout lines, but require flat walls
- **Textured or patterned tiles** — more visual interest, but layout planning matters more

For floors, durability and slip resistance are more important than for walls. Porcelain tiles are a common choice.

### Grout colour and width

Grout affects the look more than most people expect:
- **Matching grout** blends in, making the tiles the focus
- **Contrasting grout** highlights the pattern and layout
- **Wider grout lines** suit rustic or handmade tiles
- **Narrow grout lines** suit modern, minimal looks

Grout in kitchens is exposed to cooking splashes and cleaning. In high-use areas, sealing the grout or using epoxy grout can reduce staining.

## What to expect during a kitchen tiling job

1. **Site check** — Confirm benchtop and cabinetry are installed, wall surface is ready
2. **Layout planning** — Mark out tile positions, confirm cut placement and edge finishing
3. **Tiling** — Adhesive applied, tiles set and levelled, cuts made as needed
4. **Grouting** — Grout applied, cleaned, and sealed if required
5. **Finishing** — Silicone at junctions, final clean

For a standard splashback, this typically takes 1–2 days. Floor tiling takes longer depending on the area.

## Questions worth thinking through

- Are benchtops and cabinetry already installed?
- Where will cuts fall — especially around outlets and edges?
- What grout colour and width suits the tile and the overall kitchen design?
- Do the tiles need sealing, and does the grout need sealing?
- Who's coordinating with other trades if timing matters?

These aren't complicated questions — but thinking them through before the job starts avoids surprises.

No pressure, no obligation. I typically respond within one business day.

If you can share details about your cabinetry and benchtop timing, I can give you a clearer picture of how the tiling fits in.

Kitchen tiling is usually straightforward — the key is planning the layout and timing before tiles go on.
