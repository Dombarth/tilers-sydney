At Harbour Tiling we specialise in the aspects of kitchen tiling including splashbacks, floor tiling and feature walls for residential and commercial customers across Sydney. The team have been providing kitchen tiling services for many years and are fully licensed to carry out all aspects of tiling work.

Kitchen splashback tiling is one of the more common services we provide.

The tilers at Harbour Tiling have experience with all types of kitchen layouts and can work around existing cabinetry and appliances.

For kitchen floor tiling we can handle all aspects of substrate preparation including levelling, removal of existing flooring and ensuring the surface is suitable for tiling. The team have experience with both timber subfloors and concrete slabs.

We service customers throughout Sydney including Ryde, West Ryde, North Ryde, Eastwood, Epping, Gladesville and surrounding suburbs areas. For apartment kitchens we have experience with strata logistics including lift bookings and working within building hours.
