      <h2>Why tiling work matters</h2>
      <p>Good tiling lasts for years. It's one of the few finishes in a home that people see and touch every day. When it's done well, it looks effortless. When it's not, you notice.</p>
      <p>Most tiling problems come from what happens before the tiles go on — preparation, substrate condition, waterproofing sequencing, and layout planning. That's where I focus.</p>
